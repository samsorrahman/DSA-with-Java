Imagine you have a list of numbers in a specific order, and you want to arrange them in ascending order. Here's what you can do:
<br>
Start with the first number in your list, which is at index 0.
<br>
Check if this number is already in the correct position. In other words, see if its value is equal to its index. If it is, you can leave it where it is.
<br>
If the number is not in the correct position, find the correct position for it. To do this, subtract 1 from its value. For example, if you have the number 3 at index 0, you would calculate 3 - 1, which equals 2. So, you should move the number 3 to index 2.
<br>
Repeat these steps for each number in your list. Check if it's in the right place. If not, calculate where it should go based on its value and move it there.
<br>
By following these steps for each number, you'll eventually arrange the entire list in ascending order. This process ensures that each number ends up where it belongs, making the list sorted.
